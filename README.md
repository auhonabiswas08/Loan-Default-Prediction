• Objective  
  To conduct a comprehensive analysis of a loan dataset using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for default prediction, enhancing financial risk assessment.

• Approach  
  Trained an ANN model using Keras to predict loan outcomes with improved accuracy and reliable performance.  
  Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and validation curves for thorough performance assessment.

• Results  
  Achieved an accuracy of 0.91, indicating strong predictive capability.  
  Continuously monitored model behavior by visualizing learning curves to assess training convergence and stability.
